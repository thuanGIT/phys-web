# Pre lab 8

Here are some help for Pre lab 8!
___

## Part 1

````{margin}
```{tip}
Look back at Lab 6!
```
````

- The magnetic field model is similar **(not the same)** in many aspects to the Electric Field Model.
- Now, given a magnet with North and South pole, could you guess what setup it resembles in Electric Field Model?
- Then, where do the Magnetic Field lines start? Where do they end?

```{caution}
There are rules with drawing magnetic field lines that you should take into consideration. E.g. lines do not touch.
```

## Part 2

- This is just a restatement of the **Right Hand Rule For Solenoids**.
- Don't forget to tell me which finger indicates the direction of **current** and which indicates **magnetic field**.

```{tip}
If words are not enough for you, please feel free to visualize it with a drawing.
```

## Part 3

- Galvanometer is a device. A device's name ending with **meter** is usually the one to measure a quantity.
- The question now is **what galvanometer measures?**

```{tip}
What is the general name of the device to measure that quantity that you just found out?
```

## Part 4

- Use the right hand rules for this part!
- Remember which finger is assigned to which quantities!

```{caution}
The right hand rule works a little different for moving negative charge!
```

## Part 5

- For this question, you need to look at the dependencies of $B$.
- That means you need look at the formula for $B$ and see if any changes of the component terms affect $B$ as described.

## Part 6

- Given 2 important pieces of information:
  - Objects are **moving charged particles**.
  - Both enter **the same magnetic field** perpendicular to their velocity.

- With knowledge of mechanical physics, we know **force** causes acceleration and change in motion.

- Why is it important? Two of your objects changes direction in opposite way after entering magnetic field. That means each experienced a force that is opposite in direction to each other.

- Now, ask yourself: **Why the force exerted on each object is opposite in direction?**.

- Here is a visualization for you:

:scale: 25
```

```{tip}
Look at the formula for magnetic force on moving charge: $\vec{F} = q \vec{v}\times\vec{B}$.
```

## Part 7

- Follow the below formula (for solenoid) for this calculation:

$$B = \mu_0 n I$$

```{caution}
n is the number of turns per unit of length! Read carefully what you are given!
```
