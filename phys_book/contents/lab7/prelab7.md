# Pre Lab 7

Here are some help for Pre lab 7!
___

+++

## Part 1: Find $m$

- You start with the given formula relating mass and volume:

$$\rho = \frac{m}{V}$$

- Now that you have $\rho$ (density) and $m$ (mass) in the equation, what about $V$, the volume? Let's look at the figure below:

```{figure} ../../images/lab7/battery_lab7.jpeg
:scale: 40
```

- So, do you remember how to the find the volume, given cross-section area function **(the same at all height)** and height?

```{caution}
That figure does not tell whether the cross-section is circular. So, do not assume so. Please use the generic term $A_b$ for area.

## Part 2: Find $w$

There are not tricks here!

- $w$ is the term to indicate weight/gravitational force acting on a given fluid surface in this case.

- At this point, you should know how to find it!

- Start by asking yourself what is pressure?

> Pressure is the force per unit area.

- If you understand, you will think about this formula involing **pressure difference**:

$$\Delta{P} = \frac{F}{A_b}$$

```{tip}
Free body diagram if you want details. Otherwise, it is whatever is available until now in pre lab.
```
````

- Now, ask yourself what is $F$ in this case? In the concept of fluid, the agent that exerts a force on a fluid cross-section at a certain height is all parts of fluid above that height right?

- Then, what does that force equal to? Hopefully, it is clear.

```{caution}
For all questions above, make sure to **give the equation in required terms** from the question.
