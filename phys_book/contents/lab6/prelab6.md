# Pre Lab 6

Here are some help for Pre lab 6!
___

+++

## Part 1

- This is a simple **Uncertainties Calculations** with Ohm Laws. Use the formula:

$$R = \frac{\Delta{V}}{I}$$

- Use the rules of multiplications to finish the question.

```{attention}
Read the question carefully for which terms should be present!
```

+++

## Part 2

- A **circular cross-section** should give you the sense of the formula for A:

$$A = \pi r^2$$

- Now, obtain the formula in term of d (diameter) and the uncertainty for A.

```{tip}
Use the power rule for this task!
```

- Next, we need to find uncertainty for the **inverse of A**:

$$x = A^{-1}$$

- Hopefully, you see it is applied with the rules of multiplication.
