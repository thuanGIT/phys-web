## About me

My name is Thuan(Jamie Vo). I am currently in second year, majoring in Computer Science (nothing to do with Physics). Though my knowledge and experience in this field cannot be compared to other TAs, I was in your situation last year and fully understood your hate (maybe too much) for physics. So, I am here to help you get over this "evil" Physics thingy. Really excited for a great semester with you all!
