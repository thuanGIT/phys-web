# Lab 4

Here are some help for lab 4.
___



## Overview

- I think it seems like a lot of work but no worries its super quick!

- You will need some tapes and Logger Pro to finish the lab.

## Part 1: Attraction and repulsion of charged and neutral objects

- Part 1 requires you with some equipment:
    - Tape (<mark>It does not have to be Scotch</mark>).
    - Smartphone/Camera (just for taking picture).
    - Youtube videos (<font color='red'><b>super helpful!</b></font>).

### Setup Visualization

- Before we go any further, it is helpful to have a picture of the experiment setup.

```{figure} ../../images/lab4/setup_part1_lab4.jpg
```

- Note that you will need to use **7 pieces** of tape in total.

```{tip}
Watch the video first before you do it! 
```

### Setup instruction

- Now, let's have a brief version of the instruction.
    - Step 1: Take out 1 piece of tape, touch it gently to discharge, put it on anything insulated and mark it **N**.
    - Step 2: Stick 2 pieces on a surface (e.g. table). Those are called **workingspaces**.
    - Step 3: Take out 2 pieces, folder one end down a little and mark it **B**.
    - Step 4: Take 2 more pieces, do the same as step 3 and mark it **T**.
    - Step 5: Pick 1 workspace. Pull up **B** and **T** at the same time. Stick them (hanging) on a surface. Now, **B** is in position. So, slowly pull **T** out and stick it nearby.
    - Step 6: Do the same for the other workspace.

- Now, you have set up your experiment. Follow the later instruction to observe the behavior and record it in your report sheet.

```{tip}
Same charges repels. Different charges attract!
```
````
- One question will ask you to watch one video to identify the charge of each label. Make sure you watch it to answer the question. It will be super clear.

```{note}
For drawing the tape, you will have to show me which tape is negatively charged and which tape is positively charged.
```

## Part 2: Measuring the charge on a pith ball

- For this part, there is just a picture for you to insert in Logger Pro and do analysis.

- Make sure when you do it, choose <font color='red'><b>Picture with analysis</b></font>.

### Setup visualization

- Let's have a look of what the setup look likes.

### Setup instructions

- Follow the manual and repeat similar steps as previous labs.

- After you follow the manual's instructions, you will use the **vertical ruler** for measuring distance between 2 points. Here is the sample Logger Pro window.

```{caution}
In this picture, I only show how to find Dp. You will have to also find Ds!
```

```{note}
Please choose either meter or centimeter! Don't mix them up!
```

### Free Body Diagram and Calculations

- When you are done, record the values in the report sheet' table. 

- Now, start calculating $\theta$ by using only $D_{p}$ and $D_{s}$. This will be use later.

- Next, draw your body diagram on **1 ball only**.

- From there, based on the observed system, we have $F_{net} = 0$. Break the forces into components and calculate $F_{e}$.

- Having $F_{e}$ and equally charged balls meaings we can find the charge on each ball via **Coulomb Law**.

```{warning}
Don't forget to calculate uncertainties. Show your work!
```




## Discussion

- The last question asks you to know how the angle behaves in response to the change in charge of each ball.

- Now, this is a common proportional relationship between 2 quantities. **I would start by writing down relating formula and assume other quantities constant**.

```{caution}
Proportional relationship is not limited to linearity!
```

## Attachments

- You are required to submit pictures of your experiment setup in part 1.

- Here are the sample picture I want you to submit.
