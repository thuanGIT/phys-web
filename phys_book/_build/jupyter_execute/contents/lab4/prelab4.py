## Part 1

### Question 1
- Basically, you tell me what Coulomb's Law is.

- What I want from you is: ***brief description*** and ***main formula***.

```{tip}
You can go to your note and copy them out! It's a law with a formula similar to that of Newton's attractive force.
```

### Question 2

- Well, this is a conceptual question that I believe everyone knows how to do it! It is just common sense and you can even test it yourself.

- There is nothing tricky here!


## Part 2

- Until now, everyone should be good with dealing with algebra and units.

- This question is just simple calculations by **destroying unwanted units**.

```{tip}
Write out the units of each quantity!
```
