# Lab 5
Here are some stuffs for Lab 5!
___


## Overview

- This lab might seem a little too long but eventually it is not that bad. 

- You need an image editor to annotate your screenshots. E.g. Paint, Preview, PS.

- We will need to plot 2 graphs from LoggerPro.

- Excel work will start this week.

```{attention}
Please read the instructions in the manual on how to use the simulator!
```

## Part 1: The Electric Dipole
````{margin}
```{tip}
Electric field lines are going from higher potential to lower potential and perpendicular to equipotential lines.
```
````
- Here, all you need to do is to place <mark><b>2 opposite charges</b></mark> on 2 halves of the surface (one left and one right).
- Then, you use the device with the **cross-hair** to draw the equipotential lines. How? **Click the pencil**.
- Make sure you follow the required steps (not necessarily exact). In this case, it is $\pm3(V)$.
- Then, you need to draw **Electric field Lines** given the equipotential lines.
- Here a demo for you to follow:

```{figure} ../../images/lab5/part1.png
:scale: 50
```

```{warning}
Every image contains metadata, including author and created date. So, I would know whether you did it or copied somewhere.
```

## Part 2: Pair of Like Charges
````{margin}
```{tip}
In case you don't see the potential you're looking for, move the device up and down from the middle.
```
````
- The procedure is similar to part 1. The only difference is that you place <mark><b>2 same charges</b></mark> on 2 halves of the surface.
- Make sure you follow the required steps (not necessarily exact). In this case, it is $\pm1(V)$.
- Then, draw the **Electric field lines**. Here is a demo for you:

```{figure} ../../images/lab5/part2.png
:scale: 45
```
```{caution}
Here, we have 2 like-charges. So be careful with the direction of the electric field lines.
```


## Part 3: A Line of Charge
```{tip}
Keep track on the number of charges. Usually ~55-58 charges.
```
- This part requires you to assemble a **line of charges**. Make sure to<font color='red'><b>fill the entire browswer length</b></font>.
```{seealso}
Filling the entire length ensures that it behaves like a line of charges. Otherwise, some discrepancies might happen.
```
- Here is demo of the setup for you to follow:
```{figure} ../../images/lab5/part3.png
:scale: 50
```

### Section 1: Find the charge per unit length Î»

- You have the equation:
$$\lambda = \frac{n * q}{L} (C/m)$$
where n(number of charges), q(charge per point charge), L(length of line)

```{tip}
q is given in the simulator! Find it! Use nC or C.
```
- So, you need to keep track on how many points you put in. Also, to find the length of the line, **use the scale with the plus symbol at the tip**.


### Section 2: Find estimated eletrical field strength Ex (V/m) at a point

### Section 3: Find estimated potential Vx (V) at a point


## Discussion

- We do not have a discussion part for this lab. But there are few things you need to remember.
- There are several questions asking you to describe the pattern. So, please give your best observations. It must be your own.

```{tip}
One important concepts: The closer the equipotential lines are, the stronger the eletric field in those areas.
```

## Excel Work

- **Please keep track on the schedule. Rules must also be followed.**
