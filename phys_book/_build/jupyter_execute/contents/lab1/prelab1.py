# Pre Lab 1

In this section, you will find the hints to your pre lab! Remember that I have you as many hints as I could. So please do not cheat!

___

## Overview
- There are 2 parts in this pre lab assignment. 
    - Part 1: True/False
    - Part 2: Data Import and Analysis
- It is worth 2 points and <font color=red><b>due before lab 1 (11: 59PM PST January 28th, 2021)</b></font>


## Part 1
- Recall what happens if a string is stretched or compressed. More specifically, what is its tendency to react to such events?
- The next question is just a simple force identification right?

## Part 2
- Step 1: Take the data and put it in Logger Pro table (left panel)
- Step 2: Select *Analyze > Linear Fit*.

- Step 3: A box appears. Make sure it shows uncertainties (double click it for settings).
- Step 4: Change x- and y-axis label (Name and Units) by *Data > Column options*.

- Step 5: Extract your k values. Where? Look into this formula:
$
\color{red}F \color{red}= \color{red}k \color{red}* \color{red}|\color{red}\Delta \color{red}x\color{red}|
$

```{hint}
k is a constant with respect to each type of spring. So, which term in the equation is kept constant? Then, where is it in LoggerPro fit box?
```
- Step 6: Repeat it for the second table
- Step 7: Write down the results

```{note}
Ignore uncertainties are not included in the table. Why? It is not used for calculation.
```
