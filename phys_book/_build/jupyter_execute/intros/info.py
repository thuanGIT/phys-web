## Rules 

1. **Keep this book a secret** place for yourself or anyone registered in physics lab.
2. <font color=red><b>Do not ever release your student ID on this book.</b></font>
3. Contents are updated regularly but not guaranteed (I will try my best tho).
4. Have fun exploring! And if you spot a typo or have a great idea for edition of the page, please let me know!


```{Warning}
Please try your best to keep the rules. Otherwise, you and I are in trouble! Let's stay low.
