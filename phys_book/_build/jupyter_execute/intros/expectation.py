# Expectations

Here are the things I want you to learn from the lab!
___

## Overview
- I know this is really subjective as I base everything on what I learnt and experienced. So, before we begin, let me mark my word here.

> Skills are what you need. 
> It is your choice to decide your way to learn it.

- In other words, you don't have to follow me. Just know those skills are the essential skills!

## What you get from lab

- Now, I want to go a little deeper into what I mean.

### Descriptions

- Whenever you are asked to **observe** a physical events, keep in mind these things.
    - What you see is different from what others see. **Your view is unique**.
    - What you see might not be what is really happening. **You need to evaluate it**.
    - What you report is what you see after making adjustments. **Do not use assumptions**.

- Do your setences need to be elegant and complex? <mark>No! Information matters more!</mark>

```{attention}
Observation is the crucial steps in science. But the eyes are easily deceived.
```

### Explanations

- Whenever you are asked to **explain** a physics events, keep in mind these things.
    - Your first thoughts of the matter is not always the ultimately correct one.
    - Your second thoughts might be not.
    - Only when you think about it so many times, you will get the right idea. **Dedication matters**.
    - Explain with all your understanding and efforts. 
    - Others' idea might be right. You can use it but in your own words.
    - Other's idea might be wrong. If you suspect it, investigate it! **Do not trust what you cannot trust**. 

- Again, do your setences need to be elegant and complex? <mark>No! Information matters more!</mark>

```{caution}
Your prof's words might sound elegant but it is not coming your own mind!
```
### Data Analysis

- This is an important part that you definitely need to learn.
- What labs are all about: **Data**.
- Data are presented in raw (meaningless columns and rows).
- Your tasks: Transform the data into something useful and draw helpful information from that.
- Your next task: Explain whether your dataset is reasonable? Anything abnormal?
    - What if my data is perfect? Great! Just go on with it!
    - What if my data is screwed? No worries! Look for the error! And note it down.
    - What if my data is weird? Well, you might have discovered something! Note it donw.

- Your final task: Give your analysis on the data.
    - Comparing columns: E.g. "within experimental" meanings "there is a overlap region of those compared numbers".
    - Graph: E.g. Given a linear function, what does the slope represent? Can it be use to do something? Example in lab 2
    - Abnormal things: E.g. My data is negative but most of my friends have positive data. What might happen?

```{warning}
A simple yes or no does not give anything useful!
```

## What you contribute to lab

- Let's talk about what you do for the labs and for me.

### Diversity

- What I am having from you all is the unique understanding and views on the subject from every individual.
- You bring new ideas into the table. You bring up problems that we, TA, have not encountered.
- You bring new ways of solving problems that beyond the answer sheets.

### Problems

- Yes, problems! You made problems for me solve such that the system can be improved.
- Your feedbacks and complains will always be heard.
