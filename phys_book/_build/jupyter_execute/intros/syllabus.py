## Academic Integrity

The academic enterprise is founded on honesty, civility, and integrity.  As members of this enter-prise, all students are expected to know, understand, and follow the codes of conduct regarding academic integrity.  At the most basic level, this means submitting only original work doneby you and acknowledging all sources of information or ideas and attributing themto others as required.  This also means you should not cheat,  copy,  or mislead others about what is your work.  You are encouraged to take measurements and discuss the experiments with your lab partners.  However, you must do and submit your own work.  Express ideas using your own words and mathematical expressions.  Violations of academic integrity (i.e., misconduct) leadto the break down of the academic enterprise, and therefore serious consequences arise and harsh sanctions are imposed.  



```{warning} Note
Just don't cheat please! I trust you all!
