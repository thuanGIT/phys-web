# Excel Rules
Here is our experiment on community driven excel sheet.

___

## Overview

- Since the typo incident in lab 2 excel sheet (**sorry!**), I realize we are depending a little too much on the provided sheet.

- As a solution, I will let everyone construct the sheet as a team instead of me doing it.

- Your contribution is recorded as described in the next section.

## Procedure

- Now, let's answer your question on how it is conducted. The following figure will represent our schedule.

scale: 70%

```

````{margin}
```{note}
We start from lab 5 since lab 4 does not need excel sheets.
```
````

- **Note**: I have change the end date a little as we don't really need that much time to work on it. I would spend Sunday to check the excel sheet everyone sends me.

```{attention}
Start day is 5PM Thursday. And end date is Saturday 11:59PM.
```



## Evaluation

- Here comes how you are given bonuses! Look at the tables below:
